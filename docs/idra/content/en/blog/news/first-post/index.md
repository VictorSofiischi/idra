**Why Go?**

Firstly, let's address the choice of Go for our CDC system. Go's simplicity, concurrency model, and performance make it an ideal candidate for building high-throughput, low-latency applications. Leveraging Go, we've crafted a CDC engine that excels in processing massive streams of data with unparalleled efficiency.

## Key Features:

Near Real-Time Data Capture: Our CDC system captures data changes from source databases with minimal latency, ensuring that downstream applications receive updates almost instantaneously.

Scalability: Built with scalability in mind, our system can effortlessly handle increasing data volumes without compromising on performance. Whether you're dealing with gigabytes or petabytes of data, our CDC solution scales horizontally to meet your needs.

Reliability: Reliability is non-negotiable in mission-critical systems. Our CDC engine is designed with fault tolerance and resiliency at its core, guaranteeing uninterrupted operation even in the face of failures.

Flexibility: We understand that every organization has unique requirements. That's why our CDC system is highly configurable, allowing users to tailor it to their specific use cases easily.

Intelligent Change Detection: Powered by sophisticated algorithms, our CDC engine intelligently detects and processes only relevant data changes, minimizing resource consumption and maximizing efficiency.

## Supported Databases and Systems:

MongoDB: Seamlessly integrate our CDC system with MongoDB, enabling real-time data streaming and synchronization.

S3: Store and process data changes directly on Amazon S3 with our CDC solution, leveraging the scalability and durability of cloud storage.

Postgres: Keep your PostgreSQL databases in sync with our CDC system, ensuring consistency across distributed environments.

MySQL: Streamline data replication and backup processes for MySQL databases with our CDC engine, simplifying management and reducing overhead.

SQL Server: Sync your SQL Server databases effortlessly with our CDC solution, enabling real-time data replication and analysis.

Kafka: Integrate our CDC system with Kafka for seamless data streaming and event-driven architectures, unlocking new possibilities for real-time data processing.

## Use Cases:
